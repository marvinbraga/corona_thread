Class package to perform parallel training with Machine Learning.

Hello guys! I made available in this repository a package of classes that performs the parallel training of Machine Learning classes.
It is a simple contribution to be used by those who need this type of solution to try to speed up the search for medicines for COVID-19.

To use just install the packages that are in the file "requirements.txt".

I provided a simple usage example that uses the "Iris Dataset".
Feel free to make changes to the code.

With all my heart I hope to help!
God bless you all!
